# You'll notice that my workflow use a lot of different tokens :
# - GITHUB_TOKEN which is an auto-generated token provided by GitHub used to commit your metrics on your repository
# - METRICS_TOKEN which is my personal scope-less token  
# - METRICS_BOT_TOKEN which is a bot account token with more scopes that I use for plugins which requires additional scopes
# 
# There are also a few application tokens : 
# - PAGESPEED_TOKEN which is a PageSpeed API token (optional for "plugin_pagespeed")
# - TWITTER_TOKEN which is twitter API token (mandatory for "plugin_tweets")
# - SPOTIFY_TOKENS which contains a client_id, client_secret and a refresh_token for Spotify (mandatory for some mode of "plugin_music")
#
# The workflow is planned for every hour, but you can change its frequency if you want, 
# though it's useless to put something lower than 15 minutes as your rendered metrics will probably still be cached by GitHub
#
# It will also run on each manual commit on "master" branch

# You can use these steps to render plugins as standalone or to understand how each of them works
# Note that : 
# - "plugins_errors_fatal" is set to "yes" so it'll make the workflow fail in case of errors, but you can set it to "no"
# - You can use the "debug" to print additional logs in your workflow (be sure to put all sensitives informations in your secrets before)
# 
# ⚠️ Following jobs uses @master branch, which is unstable but also contains unreleased features
# ⚠️ Don't use "use_prebuilt_image" option on forks, because you'll end up using official images from lowlighter/metrics
